# Biography

I am a second-year doctoral student within the Quantitative Research, Evaluation and Measurement program in the Educational Studies department. My advisor is [Professor Ann O'Connell](https://ehe.osu.edu/directory/?id=oconnell.87).

I have a background in Information Systems, and in my downtime, I enjoy using my computing skills to develop statistical tools for applied researchers. You can find links to some of my projects below.
